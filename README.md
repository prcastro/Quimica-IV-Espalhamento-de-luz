ESPALHAMENTO DE LUZ ESTÁTICO

## https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_light_scattering

	* STATIC LIGHT SCATTERING is a technique in physical chemistry that measures the INTENSITY OF THE SCATTERED LIGHT to obtain the AVERAGE MOLECULAR WEIGHT Mw of a macromolecule like a polymer or a protein in solution. 
	* Measurement of the scattering intensity at many angles allows calculation of the [..] RADIUS OF GYRATION Rg. By measuring the scattering intensity for many samples of various concentrations, the SECOND VIRIAL COEFFICIENT A2, can be calculated.

	*  For static light scattering experiments, a HIGH INTENSITY MONOCHROMATIC LIGHT, usually a laser, is launched in a solution containing the macromolecules. One or many detectors are used to measure the scattering intensity at one or many angles. 
	* The angular dependence is required to obtain accurate measurements of both molar mass and size for all macromolecules of radius above 1-2% the incident wavelength. 
	* Hence simultaneous measurements at several angles relative to the direction of incident light [....] MULTI-ANGLE LIGHT SCATTERING (MALS) [...] is generally regarded as the STANDARD IMPLEMENTATION OF STATIC LIGHT SCATTERING

	* All commercial instruments are calibrated using a strong, known scatterer like toluene since the Rayleigh Ratio of toluene and a few other solvents were measured using an absolute light scattering instrument.

	* For a light scattering instrument composed of many detectors placed at various angles, all the detectors need to respond the same way. Usually detectors will have slightly different quantum efficiency, different gains and are looking at different geometrical scattering volumes. In this case a NORMALIZATION OF THE DETECTORS IS ABSOLUTELY NEEDED. To normalize the detectors, a measurement of a pure solvent is made first.
